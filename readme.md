# Llmbit.net

Open-Source llmbit.net

Dotnet bindings for bitnet made possible by [bitnet.cpp](https://github.com/microsoft/BitNet/) and [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp)

Project abandoned as it seems it is simply possible to use [LlamaSharp](https://github.com/SciSharp/LLamaSharp) and Bitnet together. See demo in this repo. 

The native dlls were built with the instructions  [bitnet.cpp](https://github.com/microsoft/BitNet/) and copied to /runtimes/Llmbit.net.Runtime.Cpu/win-x64/

The 1bit models were quanitzed with the instructions in  [bitnet.cpp](https://github.com/microsoft/BitNet/)
